# Data-Structure-Project-Open-GL-Tower-Of-Hanoi
I have made the Tower of Hanoi game in C++ data structure  using Open GL.

What is Tower of Hanoi?
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes.
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. 
The goal of the Tower of Hanoi is to move all the disks from the leftmost rod (Tower 0) to the rightmost rod (Tower 2),
following the rules below.

 RULES
•	Only one disk can be moved at a time.
•	Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
•	No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

#How to Play the game
You can play game with three keys (1 , 2. 3)
Press '1', '2', or '3' to select the source rod (rods 1, 2, or 3, respectively).
Press '1', '2', or '3' again to select the destination rod for the move.


#  Requirments
Visual Studio 2022
Open GL installed 

# I have used nupengl.core package which contains necessary libraries to run open gl
To install this package go to the tools section in Top bar of visual studio. Then hover over the nuget package manager option and click on package manager console. Run the command Install-Package nupengl.core in console . It will install all packages autoamtically.
